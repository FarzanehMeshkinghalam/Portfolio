## <span style="color:yellow;">Project 1: Steel Defect Detection using CNN

**Objective:** Identify defects in steel production.

**Dataset:**
- Training Set: 12,568 images
- Test Set: 5,506 images

**Approach:**
I employed three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, each with distinct layers and hyperparameters. The models were trained on a dataset containing various defects in steel.

**Outcome:**
After rigorous training and testing, the CNN models achieved an accuracy of 80.50% in detecting defective steel images. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in implementing CNNs for image classification but also addresses a real-world challenge in quality control within the steel production process.
