**Objective:** Identify defects in steel production. 

**Dataset:**
- Training Set: 12,568 images
- Test Set: 5,506 images

**Approach:**
I employed three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, each with distinct layers and hyperparameters. The models were trained on a dataset containing various defects in steel.

**Outcome:**
After rigorous training and testing, the CNN models achieved an accuracy of 80.50% in detecting defective steel images. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in implementing CNNs for image classification but also addresses a real-world challenge in quality control within the steel production process.

**Objective:** Forecast the number of orders for the next 10 weeks based on historical data.

**Dataset:**
- 456,548 entries over 145 weeks

**Tasks:**
- Data preparation, including cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering, incorporating lag features and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
- Data splitting into training, validation, and testing sets

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
I presented four insightful visualizations using Python to uncover key patterns and trends in the dataset.

**Modeling:**
Utilizing both traditional machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and deep learning models (Simple RNN and LSTM) to address the forecasting challenge.

**Evaluation:**
The LSTM model emerged as the most effective, achieving the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.37 and the highest R-squared value of 0.995, establishing itself as the optimal solution for accurate demand forecasting in the delivery industry based on historical time series data.
